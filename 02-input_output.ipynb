    "[**Built-in Types**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to types, programming languages may be divided into two distinct categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **Statically typed**        language that require the programmer to define the type for every variable (statically typed).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] **Dynamically typed**       languages that define and maintain the types on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that, unlike statically typed languages, we rarely need to worry about the *type* definitions because in the majority of cases, Python takes care of them for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remember\n",
    "In a dynamically typed language, it is the value of a variable that determines the type. This is because the types are determined on the fly by the Python interpreter as and when it encounters different variables and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Topic\n",
    "In computer programming, type systems are syntactic methods to enforce and / or identify levels of abstraction. An entire field in computer science has been dedicated to the study of programming languages from a type--theoretic approach. This is primarily due to the implication of types and their underlying principles in such areas in software engineering as optimisation and security. To learn more about the study of type systems, refer to: Pierce B. Types and programming languages. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press; 2002.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "The values determine the type of a variable in dynamically typed languages. This is in contrast with statically typed languages where a variable must be initialised using a specific type before a value --- whose type is consistent with the initialised variable, can be assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why learn about *types* in a dynamically typed programming language?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to define variables in Python, you may have noticed that depending on the value, there are different forms of variables such as ```int```, ```float```, and ```str```. These are built-in definitions known as variable *types*. In essence, types tell the computer how much space in the memory should be reserved for the value of a specific variable, and clarify the operations that may be applied to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python enjoys a powerful type system out of the box. Table [Built-in types in Python](#tb:types:nativeTypes) provides a comprehensive reference for the built-in types in Python.

This is because local variables are easier to distinguish, and thus reduce the chance of making mistakes --- e.g. unintentionally redefine or alter the value of an existing variable. \n",

    "\n",
    "I. A variable that is defined in the outer scope, can be *accessed* or *called* in the inner scopes, but it cannot be *altered* implicitly. Not that such variables may still be altered using special techniques (not discussed). \n",

    "II. A variable that is defined in the innermost scopes (local), can only be *accessed*, *called*, or *altered* within the boundaries of the scope it is defined in.\n",

    "III. The inner scopes *from* which a variable is referenced must themselves have be contained within the defining scope --- e.g. in ```FuncB``` of figure [Variable scopes](#fig:opts:scopes), we can reference ```a```, ```b```, and ```x```; but not ```f1```. This is because the scope of ```f1``` is ```Script``` <kbd>→</kbd> ```FuncA```, so it can only be referenced from ```Script```  <kbd>→</kbd> ```FuncA``` <kbd>→ ...</kbd>, but not  ````Script```<kbd>→  ...</kbd> or ```Script``` <kbd>→</kbd>  ```FuncB``` <kbd>→ ...</kbd>.\n",

It is only then that the commands are processed and executed by the computer. On that account, a variable (or a function) can be referenced only *after* its initial definition. That is why, for instance, in ```Script (part 2)``` of figure [Variable scopes](#fig:opts:scopes), we can reference every variable and function except for ```FuncC```, which is declared further down the code hierarchy. \n",
